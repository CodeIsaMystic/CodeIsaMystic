## Still learning...

Following road maps, learning plans, trends and best practices to make my work more professionnal... 

## Coding as a lifestyle

I think that coding don't necessary need to be a "passion", the main thing it's to love what you're doing day after day. 
It's just need to adapt your lifestyle, getting some challenges and being aware of what you can and have to do in a special situation...
After that, it's just cool struggling with issues. It's just enjoying struggling with programs.


## Designing things 

Reading Design, having a nice user experience, think clean, pure and efficient! 
Customizing and Optimizing layouts is a really great challenge. Defining "Blocks, Elements, Components" needs to be clearly visualized. Defining patterns in a really great way to.
That's so gratifying to play around with the mix of patterns which are so different and starting manipulate. 

I really love the principals of Design Systems, files architecture organization, CSS's B.E.M approach or some other notions of designing websites attempting to have in mind a great idea of a visual.

Designs also must have to consider all the importance of accessibility and must be rich of content.

## Focusing the products

Some coders just love programming, just think in terms of "algo". They're going deeper on the program, for sure, making a bad ugly bootsrap UI ;) just to make it works and that's fine, we just need advanced stuffs! 
I'm just not following this way... I need to think the utility of my work is fully related with the User Experience they could have with the product. And even I have to go slowly in terms of programs, I just want my product is a kind of well design, "clean code", complete and simply efficient.

I cannot develop a software without thinking the potentials issues we could encounter globally. I have to looking at a problem in a User Experience focus, that's my way to do.
I just make the product primordial.
