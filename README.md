## Loving learning...

...have a better explanation to job I made, to add more details on what I've done sure but also on what I think it's important. Giving a overview of different topics, good approaches & practices. 




## Design 

Reading Design, having a nice user experience, think clean, pure and efficient! 
Defining patterns in a really great way to. Blocks, Elements, Components are clearly, Customized and Optimized layouts are ..... of the richness and mix of patterns so different from each other. 

I really love using Design Systems, files architecture organization, CSS 's B.E.M Methodology for classes or some other notions of designing websites attempting to have in mind a great visual of design.
